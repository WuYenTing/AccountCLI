TODO
1. Authentication and Security Enhancements
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enhance security by integrating a two-factor authentication mechanism using email or SMS.
Password Reset Functionality: Allow users to reset their passwords if they forget them, with verification via email or security questions.
2. Data Management Features
Data Export: Add functionality to export records to formats like CSV, Excel, or JSON for easier sharing and analysis outside the application.
Data Import Enhancements: Enhance the existing loadfile feature to support more file formats or more complex import configurations (e.g., mappings for columns).
3. Reporting and Analysis Tools
Generate Summary Reports: Allow users to generate reports such as monthly expenses, category-wise spending, or top categories by expenditure.
Graphs and Charts: Integrate basic plotting to display data trends using ASCII art or external libraries, if the terminal supports it.
4. User Experience (UX) Improvements
Command Autocompletion: Implement command autocompletion for a smoother user experience.
Help System Enhancements: Provide context-sensitive help that gives more detailed information based on the current command.
5. Additional Functional Commands
Undo/Redo Actions: Implement undo/redo functionality to revert any unintended operations.
Clone Records: Allow users to clone existing records, making it easier to add repetitive entries with minor changes.
6. Error Handling and Logging
Enhanced Error Messages: Ensure error messages are clear and provide guidance on potential solutions.
Logging Activity: Implement logging for user activities and errors for audit purposes and easier debugging when issues arise.
7. Customization and Configuration
Settings Configuration: Allow users to configure settings such as default file paths, currency format, etc.
Theme Support: Provide options to change the color scheme or layout of the interface for better user personalization.
8. Integration
Third-Party Integrations: Consider integrating with external systems like email clients for notifications or cloud storage services for backups.
API Access: Develop an API to allow external systems to programmatically interact with your accounting system, enabling easier integration with other software.
9. Backup and Restore
Automatic Backup: Implement automatic data backups at regular intervals or before critical operations.
Restore from Backup: Add functionality to restore data from backups when needed.
10. Multiple files input
Support multiple files input: Consider some user may have many record files, which may cost too much time.
Support directory input : Support directory input and the ACLI can read and input all the files in the directory
